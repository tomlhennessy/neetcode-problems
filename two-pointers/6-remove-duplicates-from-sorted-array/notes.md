# Problem Restate:
Remove duplicates from a sorted array, sorting elements in place and returning the number of unique elements.

# Key Design question:
Use two pointers: one to scan and one to write.

# Complexities:
time complexity: O(n)
space complexity: O(1)

# What I learned:
Two pointers can be used to keep a running track of unique elements

# Mistakes Made:
- forgetting to start at index 1
- forgetting to return number of unique elements
