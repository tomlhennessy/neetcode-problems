# Problem Restate:
Reverse the characters in an array in-place.

# Key Design question:
Use a left and right pointer to swap elements.

# Complexities:
time complexity: O(n)
space complexity: O(1)

# What I learned:
Swapping elements in an array is an efficient way of moving them without having to shift all other elements

# Mistakes Made:
- forgetting to create a temp variable
