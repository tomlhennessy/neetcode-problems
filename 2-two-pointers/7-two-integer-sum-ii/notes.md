# Problem Restate:
Return indexes of two numbers (non-decreasing 1-indexed array) that sum up to target.

# Key Design question:
Can use a left and right pointer from either end as array is sorted.

# Complexities:
time complexity: O(n)
space complexity: (1)

# What I learned:
Consider how a sorted array may impacts a solution

# Mistakes Made:
- forgetting to return empty array in edge case.
